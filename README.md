Paike
======
Paike is a project proposed by [Li Shijian](http://github.com/furtherLee) as a course project of Web Design in Shanghai Jiaotong University. The project targets to provide a portable and flexible way for managers of clubs to assign different jobs. 

Motivation
-----------
Li was an staff of the Modern Stadium of Shanghai Jiaotong University. Mr. Lan is the one who is responsable for job arragement. Li heard from Mr. Lan that, job arrangement is so boring that would take him one hour each week, only randomly assign one person to one job. Li thought such a work can be easily finished by a simple Matching Algorithm. So, Li wrote a small program to help Mr. Lan in C++, which only takes less than 1s to finish the whole work. But, this program is specified to the job system of our Stadium.

Many friends of Li are presidents of different clubs. They told Li that they all have such problems. Jobs are randomly assigned to whoever has time, which is simple but boring. They put the results in to an excel(OK, I'm not a Windows fun), then send it to all their members or a public email. Therefore, Li and his friends, Zhang Xinjian, and Jiang Zhansheng, decide to take this topic as our final project in the Web Design Course.
